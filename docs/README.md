# Documentation

This folder contains the full documentation for sligo-terraform, served via [GitHub Pages](https://sligo-ai.github.io/sligo-terraform/).

## GitHub Pages Configuration

In your repo: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**

- **Source:** Deploy from a branch
- **Branch:** main (or your default)
- **Folder:** `/docs` — use the docs folder as the source so `index.md` becomes the site homepage

If you keep the default (root), the main README stays as the homepage and these docs are at `/docs/`.
